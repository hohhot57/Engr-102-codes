"""
Calculate the pressure of 5 moles of an ideal gas with a volume of 0.25 m^3, and temperature of 
415 K. The Ideal Gas Law is the equation of state of a hypothetical ideal gas and is a good 
approximation of the behavior of gases under many conditions. Use a value of 8.314 
m^3Pa/KÂ·mol for the gas constant. The standard unit of pressure in the SI system is kilopascals 
(kPa).
