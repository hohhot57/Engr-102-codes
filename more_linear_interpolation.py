 #1) linearly interpolate between (t0, x0) and 
#(t2, x2) for t1 with x1 as the result; 2) repeat for (t0, y0) and (t2, y2) for t1 with y1 as the result; 3) repeat 
#for (t0, z0) and (t2, z2) for t1 with z1 as the result. The result will be (x1, y1, z1) associated with time t1. 

#At time 12 seconds, observed position was (8, 6, 7) meters 
#â€¢ At time 85 seconds, observed position was (-5, 30, 9) meters 
# You want to find the position at time 30 seconds
